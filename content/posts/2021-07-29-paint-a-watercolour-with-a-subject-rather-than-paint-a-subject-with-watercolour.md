I started watercolour painting 6 months ago. I was attaracted to watercolour way before I started learning how to paint watercolour. The radiance and intricate blending of colours is so magical. I always wonder what sort of masterful skills can create such beautiful play of colours.

It is not an easy media to learn. I started by 2 Domestika watercolour tutorials. Even though I watched the step by step video a couple of times, when I started painting, I still got lost. By the time I found the next step, my painting was all dry. After months of practice and watching painting demonstration of many artists, I realised that there are no such thing as "correct steps". The method used by each artist varies drastically. Even the same artist doesn't always paints in the same sequences. In the end it is deep understanding of the properties and interplay of paints, papers and water that makes master artists. 

After I have a bit more control on how wet paints behave on papers, I encountered another road blocker. I found I produced much better works if I copied the works from other artists. Every time before I started painting, I spent a lot of time finding a subject from my photos. Naturally I was attracted to photos with an interesting subject such as famous landmarks and tourist attractions. Unfortunately my painting had always been a disappointment compared to the original photo.

Until I came across Hazel Soan's YouTube watercolour tutorial. light and shade
