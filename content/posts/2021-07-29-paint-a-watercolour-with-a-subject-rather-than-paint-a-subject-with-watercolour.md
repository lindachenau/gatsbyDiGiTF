I started watercolour painting 6 months ago. I was attaracted to watercolour way before I started learning how to paint watercolour. The radiance and intricate blending of colours is so magical. I always wonder what sort of masterful skills can create such beautiful play of colours.

It is not an easy media to learn. I started by 2 Domestika watercolour tutorials. Even though I watched the step by step video a couple of times, when I started painting, I still got lost. By the time I found the next step, my painting was all dry.  

When imitation ends, art begins.
