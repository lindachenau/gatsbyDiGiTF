  Gatsby is a powerful React-based and GraphQL powered static site generator.
  Netlify CMS provides a SPA for creating and maintaining static content. When
  you publish the content, the data (markdown and media) are pushed to your
  Github project repository from which you can host your website on any static

I started learning web development in 2019. Although I've benn SW/HW engineer for more than 20+ years, the concept of "full stack" was only a term I saw often in job recruitment ads. Not knowing where to start, I took several hand-on courses on Plural Sight. My first project was a static website and I was asked to use Wordpress (one of the most popular LAMP stacks). It was a good starting point to learn and practice PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of JS. The only challenging part was using CSS tricks to match the layout design. 

The second project was a booking web app. I researched a few popular frameworks such as React, Angular and Laravel. I took several introductory courses to get the flavour of each. React 16.8 (The first Hooks stable release) was out at that time and Samer Buna (a Plural Sight instructor) convinced me that React functional components are the future. Hooks make React component life cycle so much easier to manage. After deciding using React, CRA framework seemed a a good starting point for my first PWA project. Thanks to the rich React ecosystem from which I obtained UI components (Material UI) and a major functional component (react-big-calendar). I also used AWS lambda functions to implement APIs to talk to 3rd party backend services and some support functions such as sending emails, reminder SMS and automatic booking cancellations. Thanks to Fernando Medina Corey who introduced me to serverless framework on Plural Sight and I experienced the benefit of infrastructure as code for the first time.

After my second project, I decided to use my personal website as a play ground to learn and try different React frameworks. I saw a lot of raves about Next.JS and Gatsby. To give them a try, I created a very simple personal website design using CRA first as a comparison. Converting the design to Next.JS was straightforward enough. However the build of Next.JS had a very annoying content jumping on first page loading compared to the smooth loading of CRA build. To learn Gatsby, I needed to overcome my fear about GraphQL. I did a Gatsby introductory course on Plural Sight by Marcelo Pastorino. Thanks to his demo project which I used as the basis to expand my personal website. 

This is my perfect combination.
