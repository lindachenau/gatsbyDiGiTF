I started learning web development in 2019. Although I've benn SW/HW engineer for more than 20+ years, the concept of "full stack" was only a term I saw often in job recruitment ads. Not knowing where to start, I took several hand-on courses on Plural Sight. My first project was a static website and I was asked to use Wordpress (one of the most popular LAMP stacks). It was a good starting point to learn and practice PHP, HTML, CSS and a bit of JS. The only challenging part was using CSS tricks to match the layout design. 

The second project was a booking web app. I researched a few popular frameworks such ass React, Angular and Laravel. I took several introductory courses to get the flavour of each. React 16.8 (The first Hooks stable release) was out at that time and Samer Buna (a Plural Sight instructor) convinced me that React functional components are the future. After deciding using React, CRA seemed a a good starting point. Thanks to the rich React ecosystem where I obtained UI components (Material UI) and a major functional component (react-big-calendar).   

This is my perefect combination.
