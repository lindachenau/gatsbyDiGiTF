##The future of web design

Progressive Web Apps can be accessed anywhere on the web without any install friction, 
while still providing a quality mobile experience that users expect.<!-- end -->

Native mobile apps require a dedicated SW maintenance team to keep up with new iOS and
Android releases. Because there are two separate native code bases, the maintenance cost
is high. Besides users have to take an extra step to download the new mobile app release.
Unless a mobile app is well designed and needed to be accessed very frequently (e.g. several
times a day), most users would choose to just use the responsive website on their mobile
phones to avoid the hassle of downloading and adding clutter to their mobile home screen.

PWAs rival the performance of native apps but require much less device storage. Many leading 
companies utilise PWAs in their digital strategies. Those which replaced their existing websites 
with PWAS, have shown significant increase in user engagement on their new websites.

Since PWA has a common code base across multiple mobile platforms, it is easier to maintain 
compared to Native apps. It also removes future app store approval hassle and provides users 
with the benefit of zero installation. Whether you plan to build a new web app or upgrade your 
existing web app, PWAs is the most cost effective solution to cater for both desktop and mobile 
users.
